# api
The Afreum API is a collection of publically available files that allow anyone, including the Afreum development team, to build apps and services that leverarge the Afreum Ecosystem, and the Stellar blockchain on which it runs. The goal is for the vast majority of the files to be immutable, and available to anyone who wants to use or share them.
